** FORMAT **

First line is a single number N, where N is equal to the number of portal pairs in the level.

The next N lines contain the coordinates of the two portals in each portal pair as "xA yA xB yB",
where portal A and portal B are connected.

The next line is a single  number M, where M is equal to the number of switches in the level.

The next M lines contains the coordinates of a switch first, then the coordinates of every sliding wall
that switch controls. All coordinates are given as "x y", and each coordinate is separated by a single
whitespace (e.g. "xS yS x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3").

The next line is the border of the level, it exists simply to help provide a visual border to the level.

The next 30 lines should be strings whose characters in index range [1, 33] represent the level itself.

The last line is another visual border.
