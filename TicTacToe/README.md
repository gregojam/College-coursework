Mathematicians Tic Tac Toe Game for C290 Project

Rough Draft of Idea for Final project:

found some code for it for a skeleton or when we get stuck:

NOTATIONS AND SHORT HANDS:
X and O are first and second player Tiles on SB
Big Board  = BB is the tic tac toe board which encompasses 9 of the smaller ones
Small Board = SB is one of 9 individual tic taco toe boards within the BB.
Cat = A draw
BIG X = An X wins on an SB, and is shown as an X on the BB.
BIG O = same thing, but with O's.

Rules. 
• Flip a coin to see who goes first
•	Where the Previous player moved on the SB is where the next moves on the BB.
•	A Cat on the SB counts for nothing on the BB, as of now.

Clarification:

"What if my opponent sends me to a small board that’s full or that has already been won?" In that case, congratulations – you get to go anywhere you like, on any of the other boards. (This means you should avoid sending your opponent to such a board!)

Notation:

For the first player to move chooses a small board to play on as a pair (0-3, 0-3), then chooses a move within that board as a pair (0-3, 0-3).  

The second player then receives instructions from the program for which SB to play on, shown as a pair (0-3, 0-3), and is prompted to send an pair (0-3, 0-3).

And so on.
